# rock-paper-scissors
This is a game of rock paper scissors :)
I'm making this game in order to test out my knowledge of JavaScript, and I'll be doing this in accordance to TOP (The Odin Project).
I will try to make this game on my own, by implementing everything that I've learned thus far.
The game will be made, quite purposefully, in two stages:
1. The game will be played only in console of the browser
2. Once I aquire more skill, the game will be made to be played in the web page itself
